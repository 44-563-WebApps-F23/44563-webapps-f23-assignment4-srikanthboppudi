            Ah--here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3><br>
            <p>
            [Lays her hand softly on HILDA'S neck.] It is nice of you to be willing
            to sit with me. I thought you wanted to go in to my husband.<br>
             </p>

            <p>
            What should I want with him?<br>
            </p>

             <p>
             No, thank you. And besides, he is not in. He is over there with his
             workmen. But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him.<br>
             </p>

            <h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3><br>
             <p>
            He is so kind and gentle in reality.<br>
             </p>

             <p>
              He!<br>
