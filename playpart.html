            Ah--here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat.<br>


            <h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3><br>

            [Lays her hand softly on HILDA'S neck.] It is nice of you to be willing
            to sit with me. I thought you wanted to go in to my husband.<br>


            <h3>HILDA.</h3><br>

            What should I want with him?<br>


            <h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3><br>

             To help him, I thought.<br>


            <h3>HILDA.</h3><br>

             No, thank you. And besides, he is not in. He is over there with his
             workmen. But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him.<br>


            <h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3><br>

            He is so kind and gentle in reality.<br>


             <h3>HILDA.</h3><br>

              He!<br>
