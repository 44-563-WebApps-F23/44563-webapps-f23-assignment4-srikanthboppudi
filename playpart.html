            HILDA.

Ah--here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat.


MRS. SOLNESS.

[Lays her hand softly on HILDA'S neck.] It is nice of you to be willing
to sit with me. I thought you wanted to go in to my husband.


HILDA.

What should I want with him?


MRS. SOLNESS.

To help him, I thought.


HILDA.

No, thank you. And besides, he is not in. He is over there with his
workmen. But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him.


MRS. SOLNESS.

He is so kind and gentle in reality.


HILDA.

He!
